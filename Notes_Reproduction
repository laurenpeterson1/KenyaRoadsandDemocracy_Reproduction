robustness improvements:
- controls.dta file was not very reliable  (very sensitive and will not open always)
- they clear the data every time they are manipulating a different data set (this is why the pop1962_share was not found in part on dependent variable being paved roads) have to restate calculation for the pop share again
- for the do file for tables â€”> when reproduced it does not run a clear table it runs large tables for each column within the table itself




data sources for table 1 and 2
  - oberservations.xls
  - road_development_expenditure.xls
  - kenya_roads (merge with road_development_expenditure)
  - ethnic_shares.xls
  - kenya_roads (merge with ethnic_shares)
-




table 2
- paved_road_construction.xls
- kenya_roads_exp (saves as controls.dta)
- counterfactual_reallocation_pav_pop.xls
- kenya_roads_pav
    - merge with counterfactual_reallocation_pav_pop_raw
    - becomes counterfactual_pop
-counterfacutal_reallocation_pav_dist.xls
  - becomes counterfactual_pav_dist_raw
-kenya_roads_pav
  - merge with counterfactual_pav_dist_raw
  - becomes counterfactual_distance
-counterfacutal_reallocation_pav_mp.xls
  - becomes counterfactual_pav_mp_raw
- kenya_roads_pav
  - merge counterfactual_pav_mp_raw
  - becomes counterfactual_pop_distance
- use paved_road_construction
  - merge controls.dta
  - save as kenya_roads_pav (after a lot of editing)
